I had to do some dirty coding to make the page look right after sorting a column.
Initially, he StaticText filled their cells up to the padding as designed.
Sorting the columns merely changed the data inside the cells with a SetLabel() call.

Oddity #1:
The static text boxes would shrink to fit contents instead of expanding- yucko.
calling Refresh() didn't work, but Resize((W,H+1)) expanded the StaticText cells automatically.
Oddity #2:
I did not notice an actuall chnge in size even after many sortings

There might be a better way, I'd like to know.

Problem. 
StaticText doesn't have text selection which would be usefull to copy a value.
I tried using TextCtrl, but it didn't Flex-size properly.  
It seems that column sizing might have to be done by hand.
